# auto_emails_drafts_writing
This project is about automatically writing email drafts. It can search in your sent box and find the most relevant info and use it to create new reply drafts. In this way, you only need to answer once for any question asked. This program is particularly good for public service email accounts that often receive repeated inquiries.

I have also written a tutorial for it:

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions.
